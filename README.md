Custom Add-ons for Unity Visual Effect Graph

Should work with Unity 2020.1 + VFX graph 8.2 and may not work with other versions.

Custom Function Block - Based on work by @andybak
Output Buffer Context - My own work, and a work in progress at that. Meant for copying attributes to your own ComputeBuffer / StructureBuffer.

Please help me to keep this functional
