Custom Add-ons for Unity Visual Effect Graph

Should work with Unity 2020.1 + VFX graph 8.2 and may not work with other versions.

Custom Function Block: Lets you insert custom HLSL in a VFX graph. Based on work by @andybak. I have simplified it to only be a generic custom code node and nothing more.

Output Buffer Context: My own work, and a work in progress at that. This can help you to copy the resulting VFX attributes in the Output VertexBuffer to your own ComputeBuffer / StructuredBuffer.

Please contribute if you are able to help me to keep this functional before these features officially land in Visual Effect Graph.
